Examples of code:

Single ine code: 

`int myVar = 0;`

Multiple line of code(use four space at the beginning of the line):

    if (myVar == True) {
        printf("This is worth it\n");
    }

or use three backticks quotes with syntax highlighting:

```c
if (myVar == True) {
    Printf("This is good\n");
}
````
